The team, a collaboration between the departments of microbiology &amp; immunology, cellular &amp; physiological sciences and mathematics, investigated the way signals from multiple sources in our cells allow the body to fine tune its response to invading microbes.\", \"The portion of our immune system that recognizes and responds to foreign invaders (antigens) are known as B lymphocytes, or B cells. Proteins on the outside of these B cells, known as B-cell antigen receptors, differentiate between \\u201cself\\u201d molecules -- those that are native to the body -- and foreign molecules and instruct the B cells to respond by producing protective antibodies. Another type of cellular receptor, called Toll-like receptors, help B cells distinguish between harmful and non-harmful foreign matter by sending \'danger signals.\'\", \"Researchers at UBC have determined the molecular mechanism by which these receptors \'talk\' to one another and increase the sensitivity of our immune system to intruders.\", \"In a resting cell, B-cell antigen receptors are confined to an area on the outer membrane by a web of protein called a cytoskeleton. Michael Gold, the principal investigator of the study and department head of microbiology &amp; immunology, and his team found that antigen receptors on cells prepared by activation of Toll-like receptors moved around the cell membrane more quickly and in a wider area. These B-cell receptors were also more sensitive to low levels of foreign microbes. The researchers showed that these changes occurred because of a breakdown of the cytoskeleton.\", \"\\u201cThe new thing in this paper is the way to regulate this activation state by the confinement of the receptors by the cytoskeleton and how much they\\u2019re moving\\u201d said Gold.\", \"Without being confined by the cytoskeleton, the B-cell receptors are more likely to bump into one another to form clusters or encounter foreign microbes, both of which increase the likelihood of the receptors sounding the alarm when intruders are present.\", \"This new understanding of how our cells detect an infection might allow doctors to fine-tune their ability to fight infections through vaccine development.\", \"\\u201cClinical scientists would think about how to translate this into understanding how to make new vaccines or better vaccine strategies\'\\u201d said Gold.\", \"According to Gold, the study will also help scientists further comprehend how people develop autoimmune diseases and leukemias.\", \"\\u201cThat would give you maybe a way to treat these if you know the cause, that what\\u2019s driving these cells to be proliferated or activated is that their cytoskeleton is altered, maybe you can target the cytoskeleton specifically with drugs,\\u201d said Gold.\", \"Gold and his team are currently moving to confirm these findings in human blood cells and understand how our cells respond to invading antigens and these \'danger signals\' when they appear at the same time. This will help them to more fully understand how our immune systems respond to infections when they first appear.\", \"<em>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article used incorrect punctuation in one of Gold\'s quotes, which resulted in the meaning of a sentence being cut in two.

They found that one of the main places was through aluminum adjuvants, a vital ingredient in some vaccines. Shaw and Tomlijenovic then decided to investigate if there could be a link between the use of these aluminum adjuvants in vaccines and the rates of autism.\", \"Although the authors knew that such research had been widely discredited by the scientific community, they decided to look into it anyway to find a possible link.\", \"\\u201cWe are scientists,\\\" said Shaw. \\\"We do science. You can\\u2019t avoid something because it has politically or socially charged aspects.\\u201d\", \"Although autism spectrum diagnoses began to increase substantially in the 1990s, <a href=\\\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/00_pdf/CDCStudiesonVaccinesandAutism.pdf\\\">widespread research</a> discredited the link between autism and vaccines in general. The reason for the spike in diagnoses is not fully understood, although some research suggests that <a href=\\\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1919642\\\">changes in reporting practices and improved diagnostic tools</a> are contributing to the increased numbers.\", \"Still, Shaw believes that there is more at play behind the increase in autism numbers.\", \"\\u201cWe haven\\u2019t had a shift in the gene pool, so if the rates are really changing, then something else is driving it....

No. It could be corn flakes, but that\\u2019s why you ask the question,\\u201d said Shaw.\", \"In order to examine the link between aluminum and autism, they sampled CDC-recommended vaccines to determine which ones used aluminum adjuvants and in what quantity, then compared that with the autism rates. Shaw said that his study only looks at the increased rates rather than determines a causal link between autism and aluminum.\", \"\\u201cAll that [the study concluded] was that the rates of autism ... seem to be increasing fairly dramatically,\\\" said Shaw. \\\"One causal factor could be something in a vaccine. Based on what we know about aluminum, we think that aluminum could be contributing to that.\\u201d\", \"According to Shaw, he and his team went through the nine criteria developed by British statistician A.B. Hill to determine whether it was worth trying to find a causal relationship between a correlation and found that many of them were satisfied for his research.\", \"Using mice models for experiments, Shaw continued conducting research to find whether increased aluminum injections could replicate something that is similar to autism in mice. While his study could not demonstrate a link between autism and aluminum, the wording of <a href=\\\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099159\\\">the study</a> still suggests that it might be there.\", \"\\\"This is where it gets interesting. It is going to be the interception of genetic susceptibility with the presence of some toxin.... It\\u2019s not just aluminum -- some things are going to have the same sort of interaction,\\\" said Shaw. \\\"And the outcomes, no two cases are identical. So how you get there is probably as individual as the individual.\\\"\", \"Shaw also said that if the aluminum in these vaccines is contributing to rising autism rates, then the answer would not be to ban vaccines, but instead to find a safer adjuvant. He named a calcium-phosphate adjuvant as the nearest possible substitute, which is being tested for safety in a lab in France.\", \"Although the WHO discredits the study as being based purely on hypothetical correlation, Shaw said he believed the rest of the study was sound, as it has been anonymously peer reviewed and published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry.\", \"\\u201cThis was probably the most hard-assessed set of reviews I\\u2019ve ever had,\\u201d said Shaw. \\u201cI have never had anything like this in my academic career.\\u201d\", \"The CBC segment also called into question Shaw\\u2019s academic integrity, as it pointed out that he received $860,000 in grant money from the Dwoskin foundation, which has been associated with the anti-vaxxer argument.\", \"Shaw said that even though he accepted the money, his research is not guided by the foundation\'s principles.\", \"\\u201cClaire Dwoskin doesn\\u2019t call me up and tell me what to do and even if they did I wouldn\\u2019t do it,\\u201d said Shaw. \\u201cThis is science.

And his answer would\\u2019ve been \\u2018I haven\\u2019t done anything yet.\\u2019 He certainly had his eye on all sorts of things.\\u201d\", \"Elliott knows Neil had a list of mountains he wanted to climb, but if there was a pinnacle to that list, he didn\\u2019t know what it would be. \\u201cI\\u2019m sure [Neil] would be able to answer that without problems. My mind is confused by the breadth of the list,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBaker, Rainier, a lot of the summits between here and Whistler, things like Garibaldi, Judge Howay. But I think it\\u2019s kind of just all of the classic climbs, and some of the more adventurous ones. I guess for a lot of people it can be quite scary to get on a climb with very little information about it. There\\u2019s a lot of information out there now, like guidebooks have been written, but I think Neil would\\u2019ve been the one to try something new.\\u201d\", \"Equally ambitious, Steph was on track to finish her PhD -- which her supervisor confirmed will be awarded posthumously -- in the next couple months. Anticipating graduation and pondering what to do next, she started teaching herself Spanish about a year ago. \\u201cShe thought maybe Argentina or Chile might be nice to do a post-doc at,\\u201d explained Clemens, Steph successor as VOC president. \\u201cAnd again, [it was] \\u2018where\\u2019s the outdoors, where\\u2019s the climbing, where\\u2019s the mountaineering and how can I possibly go there?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"If a post-doc didn\\u2019t immediately pan out, another one of Steph\'s ideas for after graduation was to \\u2018dirtbag\\u2019 through South America. \\u201cIt basically means don\\u2019t have a job, live out of a car and climb,\\u201d explained Clemens. \\u201cIt came up a few times.\\u201d\", \"When Clemens tried to think of something that embodied who Steph was, all he could think about was how important the mountains were to her. \\u201cShe would not stay in the city if at all avoidable. So typical city activities weren\\u2019t really a thing she would do. All I can picture is Steph going to the climbing gym to train climbing, buying food to dehydrate to have lightweight food for a ski traverse. [She was] very diligent in that way.\\\"\", \"A cheerful and kind person, Steph was always more interested in the aesthetics of a particular mountain or route. She was particularly keen to go to the Bugaboos as well as Patagonia. \\u201cShe didn\\u2019t care if it was the highest or something. I don\\u2019t think she ever would\\u2019ve been interested in Everest for example. It wouldn\\u2019t have been her style. It\\u2019s more about the experience than saying \\u2018hey I climbed the highest mountain.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Overjoyed anytime she was in the mountains, Clemens remembers Steph singing a lot during trips. \\u201c[She\\u2019d sing] whatever came to her mind. Things like the \\u201cI feel pretty\\u201d from West Side Story, but the mocking version from Anger Management,\\u201d he said with a smile. \\u201cThat was her favourite. Or [she\\u2019d] just blare out the Lord of the Rings theme when it was particularly scenic.\\u201d\", \"While Neil was also an avid music fan, specifically of hip-hop and bluegrass, he liked to celebrate in a slightly different way. \\u201cWhisky was definitely one of his passions. Whisky and haggis. [He was] very conscious about his Scottish-ness,\\u201d Jens recalled. \\u201cWe did a pre-work trip together and we realized neither of us brought a whisky and we were like \\u2018f***ing shame.\\u2019 A little flask was always there. I guess it\\u2019s a general mountaineers thing, to bring a little shot of something. But if you know you have a very technical down-climb, you\\u2019d probably not have it at the top.\\u201d\", \"The group of friends had all kinds of ideas for the winter. On a backcountry skiing trip in November, Elliott, Neil and Steph made a goal of discovering huts not found in any guidebooks. \\u201cWe had identified a whole bunch of places where we thought we\\u2019d find some huts, \\u2018cause there are a lot of huts that aren\\u2019t official up there,\\u201d Elliott said. \\u201cWe were kind of reading between the lines of the guidebooks thinking \'yeah this is a good promising spot.\'\\u201d\", \"On Saturday, both Neil and Steph contacted their friends to let them know that their plans had changed. Due to a road closure, they couldn\\u2019t drive up the logging road used to access Mount Fee. Instead, they decided to head to Keith\\u2019s Hut for the night and climb Joffre Peak\\u2019s Central Couloir the next day. Steph had hiked Joffre Peak in the summertime, but neither had climbed it before, so Neil asked friends for information, while Steph took photos of a guidebook.\", \"\\u201cKeith Hut is like a two hour hike in and Joffre Peak is an absolutely gorgeous mountain,\\u201d said Clemens. \\u201cWhy this particular route? I guess that was the most similar in quality to what they were planning to do initially -- some steep snow and ice with bits of rock in between.\\u201d\", \"As Steph\'s designated emergency contact, Clemens started to get worried on Sunday night when he hadn\\u2019t heard from her or gotten any messages from the SPOT satellite device Steph was carrying. Still, delays are not uncommon in mountaineering, and at this point his thought was that maybe the climb took longer than expected and they just went back to the hut for another night because it was getting dark. He sent Steph a text message asking her to let him know when they are back and telling her that if he did not hear back he would notify authorities.\", \"The next morning, Clemens still hadn\\u2019t heard back from the climbers. Upon discussing with a mutual friend, Piotr, who was Steph\'s second emergency contact, they agreed that if the climbers were at the hut overnight, it would take them a few hours to get back out. If they still hadn\\u2019t heard from them by afternoon, they\\u2019d call the authorities. It wasn\\u2019t until the media emailed the VOC for comment about an accident involving at that point unnamed climbers that they learned anything had gone wrong.\", \"\\u201cWhen I heard that, I knew she was in that area climbing with friends, and that was when I realized that there might be a bad situation, so I looked up the news report,\\u201d said Clemens. \\u201cI kind of tried to convince myself that the descriptions of the victims wouldn\\u2019t match. So I thought okay maybe they are just there helping out.\\u201d\", \"Elliott, on the other hand, read the story and immediately expected the worst. \\u201cI thought right away that this is them,\\u201d he said. \\u201cJust from the clues, the little hints that the press dropped about the size of the party, the nature of what they were doing, having heard that they were headed in that area.\\u201d\", \"The climbers\\u2019 names couldn\\u2019t be released until their next of kin were notified, but by Monday evening friends learned from the RCMP that the families were in Scotland and Germany, which was enough to confirm the worst.\", \"\\u201cI think it took a couple of days for it to become real. It\\u2019s still making its way slowly,\\u201d said Elliott. \\u201cI mean I guess it\\u2019s been a week now and I was back at work today and able to focus for longer periods of time than I was last week. Life goes on but I guess there\\u2019s still always this funny hope or feeling that we\\u2019ll see him again, or I\\u2019ll walk over to the house and he\\u2019ll be there, or I\\u2019ll get a phone call saying \\u2018hey you wanna go skiing this weekend?\\u2019 It\\u2019ll take a while for that to go away I think.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFrom everything we see, there is nothing that we could take out of it and learn from it, so I didn\\u2019t come up with any conclusions,\\u201d said Jens. \\u201cElena, being a mother of two, she would be very very conservative, even more so than Neil and Steph. And if anything would\\u2019ve been only somewhat sketchy she would\\u2019ve said \\u2018okay stop, we\\u2019re turning around.\\u2019 And so by all of those facts I\\u2019m pretty sure they did everything they could correctly.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe cannot say oh they should have simply done this different or that different. We all wonder. I guess in the most general sense is that it was a risky place to be, but then we all knew them to be conservative in that regard,\\u201d said Clemens. \\u201cRisk is relative. They weren\\u2019t pushing hard at their limits. Was it bad luck or did they make a bad call? We can\\u2019t really tell at this point, and I don\\u2019t know if we ever will. We know they were making good time up the route up until the point when the accident happened. It didn\\u2019t appear to be very difficult for them up \\u2018til then. It\\u2019s something we\\u2019re still puzzling over, in terms of what there is to be learned.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI think when you go to the mountains you know that you can leave your life. It\\u2019s a dangerous place and I guess the more into it you get the bigger the stakes. I think that\\u2019s on the back of everyone\\u2019s mind,\\u201d said Elliott. \\u201cIt never really hits home until you lose someone I guess. You know now we\\u2019re living with the impact of a loss, we\\u2019re seeing people grieving and we\\u2019re seeing the big hole that you leave behind. I think it takes a while to process that. But I think also mountains is where you feel alive, more alive than anywhere else. That\\u2019s certainly how Neil felt. It\\u2019s a place that requires all of your energy and your focus and your attention. I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s really words to describe the rewards. There\\u2019s always this talk of why. I don\\u2019t think that it\\u2019s possible to put words. I think the only explanation is achieved by going out and experiencing and then you just know. The mountains are this beautiful place. Dangerous, for sure, but beautiful.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI think a type of reaction could be to be now more cautious or more scared of the mountains and not want to go there, but I don\\u2019t feel that way at all,\\u201d explained Emily. \\u201cMaybe the cautious part, but he lived his life to the fullest. He was always giving it 100 per cent and doing what he was passionate about, and it makes me want to do what I\\u2019m passionate about. It makes me want to go skiing and try my hardest and do the things that are the most fun and the most full of adventure, and to share that adventure with everybody.\\u201d\", \"Prior to his death, Neil organized a VOC trip for the weekend of January 30 to celebrate Robbie Burns Day, a Scottish holiday. He called it \\u201cBurns and Turns\\u201d -- photos from last year\\u2019s event show him snowboarding in his kilt. For friends who have spent the past couple weeks grieving and putting together a public memorial service, this will be an opportunity to get together and have a good time in Neil, Steph and Elena\'s memory.\", \"\\u201cNeil was like \\u2018there\\u2019s gonna be music, haggis and whisky!\\u2019\\u201d said Emily. \\u201cI think it\\u2019ll be nice to do that in his honour. It\\u2019s sad that he won\\u2019t be there but I think he\\u2019ll be there in spirit. Who knows, to think that far in advance, but it would be nice for it to be a yearly tradition.\\u201d\", \"In terms of what else the VOC does moving forward, Clemens said the club try their best to keep doing what they do while also being mindful to focus less on objectives of climbing and more on enjoying the process. \\u201cWe still want to get people excited about the outdoors. We all have to ask ourselves how much risk are we willing to take for the privilege to experience the outdoors in this way,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I think ultimately it\\u2019s worth spending time in the mountains. [Steph and Neil] wouldn\\u2019t want us to stop enjoying the outdoors.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf anything it just inspires us to keep going out. We\\u2019ll be thinking about them while we\\u2019re out in the mountains, maybe getting a bit closer to them in some ways,\\u201d added Elliott. \\u201cThey were where they liked to be, where they liked to live. I haven\\u2019t seen them but I know there were pictures recovered from Steph\\u2019s camera. And I can guarantee that if you look at those pictures you\\u2019ll see all three of them smiling, living.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe kept going back and forth.

I saw the goalie go left so I tried to go right, and lucky enough it went in for me.\\u201d\", \"The Thunderbirds came into the second period confident. They had most of the chances during the first, and were justly rewarded at the tail end. The thousands in the stands were no less energetic. David Robinson felt he needed to establish a tone early on, and gave Holfeld a bit of a snow shower, which drew some Huskies behind the net for a bout of face-washing and headlocks.\", \"The second looked better than the first for the \\u2018Birds -- the only time the puck crossed their defensive blueline was when it was iced. Bardaro took the puck right off a defender\\u2019s stick and very nearly put it in from the slot. Fleming caught a rebound from a wraparound attempt and fired it so convincingly that the red light flashed to signal a goal. The man with the best view in the house and the red stripe on his arm, however, disagreed.\", \"Not to be stonewalled for the period, the \\u2018Birds would add another. Jessi Hilton and Luke Lockhart sprung up on a 2-on-1 opportunity and made no mistake with their textbook finish. 2-0 \\u2018Birds. From there, Saskatchewan turned up the heat a little bit, but Williams stood on his head when he needed to.\", \"So it went to what everyone in the stands hoped would be the final frame. At 6:51, Robinson buried a huge rebound top shelf to put the home team up by three, and if you asked the person next to you whether there was any chance of a comeback, you might\\u2019ve gotten a funny look.

I chatted with the Thunderbirds\' leading scorer Anthony Bardaro about his top tips for improving your stickhandling in hockey. Here\\u2019s what he had to offer:\", \"<strong>Keep your hands away from your body. </strong>\", \"Your hands should move independently from your body. Many beginners keep their hands too close, or don\\u2019t separate them from their body. To avoid this, keep your shoulders down and relaxed and keep both hands in front of your body while holding your stick. As a general rule, your top hand should be about a hand\\u2019s width away from your chest. When you move your stick to stickhandle, focus on only moving your arms, not your body.\", \"<strong>Your top and bottom hands have different roles -- know them! </strong>\", \"Your top hand is the one you hold closest to the top of the stick. Your bottom hand is held about one third to one half of the way down your stick. Your top hand should be the one to rotate the stick; your bottom hand should push and pull the puck. Your top hand is best suited to rotating the stick, which you need to do if you want to push or pull the puck -- consider your top hand to be the steering wheel.\", \"Meanwhile, your bottom hand generates the leverage to actually push or pull the puck -- sort of like the engine. If your bottom hand tries to rotate, you won\\u2019t have much range of rotation, and if your top hand tries to push and pull, you won\\u2019t have much strength. Once you understand what each hand should do, you will find stickhandling much easier.\", \"When you\\u2019re looking to improve your stickhandling (or any physical skill, for that matter), you can cut your learning curve dramatically by video taping yourself. Everyone has smartphones nowadays that can shoot HD video, so it\\u2019s easy to capture yourself, either with the help of a buddy or a stack of pucks.\", \"I suggest doing some practice reps, then taping yourself, then checking your technique. Make adjustments to your technique, practice, then take another video. You will gain valuable insight on your technique that you can only get from watching yourself.\", \"Use Anthony\\u2019s tips, plus video feedback to develop your own silky mitts!\", \"<em>Jason Yee is a fourth-year kinesiology student and a defenceman on the UBC men\\u2019s hockey team.

These B-cell receptors were also more sensitive to low levels of foreign microbes.

I chatted with the Thunderbirds\' leading scorer Anthony Bardaro about his top tips for improving your stickhandling in hockey. Here\\u2019s what he had to offer:\", \"<b>Keep your hands away from your body. </b>\", \"Your hands should move independently from your body. Many beginners keep their hands too close, or don\\u2019t separate them from their body. To avoid this, keep your shoulders down and relaxed and keep both hands in front of your body while holding your stick. As a general rule, your top hand should be about a hand\\u2019s width away from your chest. When you move your stick to stickhandle, focus on only moving your arms, not your body.\", \"<b>Your top and bottom hands have different roles -- know them! </b>\", \"Your top hand is the one you hold closest to the top of the stick. Your bottom hand is held about one third to one half of the way down your stick. Your top hand should be the one to rotate the stick; your bottom hand should push and pull the puck. Your top hand is best suited to rotating the stick, which you need to do if you want to push or pull the puck -- consider your top hand to be the steering wheel.\", \"Meanwhile, your bottom hand generates the leverage to actually push or pull the puck -- sort of like the engine. If your bottom hand tries to rotate, you won\\u2019t have much range of rotation, and if your top hand tries to push and pull, you won\\u2019t have much strength. Once you understand what each hand should do, you will find stickhandling much easier.\", \"When you\\u2019re looking to improve your stickhandling (or any physical skill, for that matter), you can cut your learning curve dramatically by video taping yourself. Everyone has smartphones nowadays that can shoot HD video, so it\\u2019s easy to capture yourself, either with the help of a buddy or a stack of pucks.\", \"I suggest doing some practice reps, then taping yourself, then checking your technique. Make adjustments to your technique, practice, then take another video. You will gain valuable insight on your technique that you can only get from watching yourself.\", \"Use Anthony\\u2019s tips, plus video feedback to develop your own silky mitts!\", \"<i>Jason Yee is a fourth-year kinesiology student and a defenceman on the UBC men\\u2019s hockey team.

The beer-soaked and record-breaking crowd cheered at every opportunity, giving the T-Birds the energy to rack up a seemingly unsurpassable three goal lead late in the game. But momentum works in an exaggerated way in this league; when a rookie-filled Saskatchewan team notched their first goal of the evening at 8:46 of the third, something clicked. From that point on, the home team could only watch their dominant game unravel.\", \"3,049 was the exact number of people packed into the Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre, and it sounded like it from the moment the puck dropped.

They had most of the chances during the first, and were justly rewarded at the tail end. The thousands in the stands were no less energetic.

When the opportunity came to take on another post-doc, this time at UBC\\u2019s Centre for Blood Research, he decided to stick with academia and pursue outdoor adventures during his free time.\", \"\\u201cI think his whole time as a scientist since he finished his PhD, he was always on the fence between trying to balance his career and his desire to be in the mountains. That was ongoing for sure,\\u201d said Elliott Skierszkan, a fellow VOC\\u2019er who lived with Neil from September 2013 until about a month ago. \\u201cI guess doing scientific research is an incredibly committed thing. It\\u2019s not your typical 9-to-5 job, and I think that was always difficult for him.\\u201d\", \"No matter how busy work would get, Neil always managed to get away. \\u201cI always thought of him as a full-time mountaineer and a part-time post-doc,\\u201d said Emily Rossnagel, another housemate and outdoors enthusiast. She added that he was \\u201csuper efficient\\u201d and his time at work was well spent. Neil was half way through a successful three-year term at UBC, had won several awards and published around a dozen papers. He didn\\u2019t know what he was going to do next, but was thinking about applying for Canadian residency.\", \"Since he wasn\\u2019t a student, Neil couldn\\u2019t serve on the VOC executive panel as Steph had, but was always eager to help on instructional trips. \\u201cNeil came here knowing everything but still every time there was an instructional trip he would take his personal time to teach and share the passion,\\u201d said Jens. \\u201cHe gave back a lot even though he never learned it through the club.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe was a really good teacher because anyone who was learning from him always felt really relaxed,\\u201d added Elliott. \\u201cHe had this way of being funny and laughing at himself in this kind of self-deprecating way. So it was good to have him along because even in the worst situations he\\u2019d make a joke about himself and find it really funny. That makes everyone feel at ease.\\u201d\", \"While he was usually the most experienced climber in a group and often could have chosen more difficult objectives than those around him were doing, Neil was the type of guy who was having a blast as long as he was outdoors.\", \"\\u201c[Neil] was an incredibly skillful and experienced guy out in the backcountry, but he\\u2019d go on a trip with anyone,\\u201d added Elliott. \\u201cIt didn\\u2019t really matter who you were. He didn\\u2019t care. He\\u2019d just hang out with anyone and make a good time of it. He had this really unique ability to connect with people.\\u201d\", \"Described by his housemates as a very modest person with a bright and bubbly personality, Neil was usually nonchalant about trips beforehand, but when he\\u2019d get home on a Sunday night his excitement was always evident. \\u201cIt was always the best hearing about [his trips],\\u201d Emily recalled. \\u201cI\\u2019m like \\u2018so where\\u2019d you go this weekend?\\u2019 It was always different. I think that was the cool part. There was such a variety.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe would arrive Sunday\'s at midnight, 2 a.m., whatever, and then he\\u2019d just show up for work on Monday morning, no problem,\\u201d added Elliott. \\u201cHe was this incredible amount of energy and really full of life guy. Really, he was 31 when he died and he had lived like three lives in those 31 years, you know? I could count on a single hand the weekends that he spent at home.\\u201d\", \"When he wasn\\u2019t out climbing, skiing, snowboarding, sailing, biking, canyoneering, hanging out at the beach or doing just about any other outdoor activity one can think of, Neil was an easy-going, laid-back guy who loved to be around people. Emily has fond memories of him in the kitchen, where discount bags of vegetables were a part of many meals.\", \"\\u201cI always really liked also how often he\\u2019d come home and we\\u2019d all be in the kitchen starting to make dinner, and he\\u2019d be like \\u2018I got dollar bag soup ready!\\u2019 He wanted to be a part of everyone\\u2019s life, even if it was the little way of making soup to share.\\u201d\", \"Elliott enjoyed their extended breakfasts together in the mornings, which often ended with pulling out a map and thinking of where they\\u2019d go next. He\\u2019s not sure how many mountains Neil climbed, only that he\\u2019d summited peaks in Scotland, the Alps, B.C., Washington, Alaska, California and Japan -- it was probably quite a large number.\", {\"data\": {\"alignment\": \"center\"}, \"type\": \"advertisement\"}, \"\\u201cOne per weekend for the last \\u2026 I don\\u2019t know. Looking at the map here, you know, I don\\u2019t think it matters. And his answer would\\u2019ve been \\u2018I haven\\u2019t done anything yet.\\u2019 He certainly had his eye on all sorts of things.\\u201d\", \"Elliott knows Neil had a list of mountains he wanted to climb, but if there was a pinnacle to that list, he didn\\u2019t know what it would be. \\u201cI\\u2019m sure [Neil] would be able to answer that without problems. My mind is confused by the breadth of the list,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBaker, Rainier, a lot of the summits between here and Whistler, things like Garibaldi, Judge Howay. But I think it\\u2019s kind of just all of the classic climbs, and some of the more adventurous ones. I guess for a lot of people it can be quite scary to get on a climb with very little information about it. There\\u2019s a lot of information out there now, like guidebooks have been written, but I think Neil would\\u2019ve been the one to try something new.\\u201d\", \"Equally ambitious, Steph was on track to finish her PhD -- which her supervisor confirmed will be awarded posthumously -- in the next couple months. Anticipating graduation and pondering what to do next, she started teaching herself Spanish about a year ago. \\u201cShe thought maybe Argentina or Chile might be nice to do a post-doc at,\\u201d explained Clemens, Steph successor as VOC president. \\u201cAnd again, [it was] \\u2018where\\u2019s the outdoors, where\\u2019s the climbing, where\\u2019s the mountaineering and how can I possibly go there?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"If a post-doc didn\\u2019t immediately pan out, another one of Steph\'s ideas for after graduation was to \\u2018dirtbag\\u2019 through South America. \\u201cIt basically means don\\u2019t have a job, live out of a car and climb,\\u201d explained Clemens. \\u201cIt came up a few times.\\u201d\", \"When Clemens tried to think of something that embodied who Steph was, all he could think about was how important the mountains were to her. \\u201cShe would not stay in the city if at all avoidable. So typical city activities weren\\u2019t really a thing she would do. All I can picture is Steph going to the climbing gym to train climbing, buying food to dehydrate to have lightweight food for a ski traverse. [She was] very diligent in that way.\\\"\", \"A cheerful and kind person, Steph was always more interested in the aesthetics of a particular mountain or route. She was particularly keen to go to the Bugaboos as well as Patagonia. \\u201cShe didn\\u2019t care if it was the highest or something. I don\\u2019t think she ever would\\u2019ve been interested in Everest for example. It wouldn\\u2019t have been her style. It\\u2019s more about the experience than saying \\u2018hey I climbed the highest mountain.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Overjoyed anytime she was in the mountains, Clemens remembers Steph singing a lot during trips. \\u201c[She\\u2019d sing] whatever came to her mind. Things like the \\u201cI feel pretty\\u201d from West Side Story, but the mocking version from Anger Management,\\u201d he said with a smile. \\u201cThat was her favourite. Or [she\\u2019d] just blare out the Lord of the Rings theme when it was particularly scenic.\\u201d\", \"While Neil was also an avid music fan, specifically of hip-hop and bluegrass, he liked to celebrate in a slightly different way. \\u201cWhisky was definitely one of his passions. Whisky and haggis. [He was] very conscious about his Scottish-ness,\\u201d Jens recalled. \\u201cWe did a pre-work trip together and we realized neither of us brought a whisky and we were like \\u2018f***ing shame.\\u2019 A little flask was always there. I guess it\\u2019s a general mountaineers thing, to bring a little shot of something. But if you know you have a very technical down-climb, you\\u2019d probably not have it at the top.\\u201d\", \"The group of friends had all kinds of ideas for the winter. On a backcountry skiing trip in November, Elliott, Neil and Steph made a goal of discovering huts not found in any guidebooks. \\u201cWe had identified a whole bunch of places where we thought we\\u2019d find some huts, \\u2018cause there are a lot of huts that aren\\u2019t official up there,\\u201d Elliott said. \\u201cWe were kind of reading between the lines of the guidebooks thinking \'yeah this is a good promising spot.\'\\u201d\", \"On Saturday, both Neil and Steph contacted their friends to let them know that their plans had changed. Due to a road closure, they couldn\\u2019t drive up the logging road used to access Mount Fee. Instead, they decided to head to Keith\\u2019s Hut for the night and climb Joffre Peak\\u2019s Central Couloir the next day. Steph had hiked Joffre Peak in the summertime, but neither had climbed it before, so Neil asked friends for information, while Steph took photos of a guidebook.\", \"\\u201cKeith Hut is like a two hour hike in and Joffre Peak is an absolutely gorgeous mountain,\\u201d said Clemens. \\u201cWhy this particular route? I guess that was the most similar in quality to what they were planning to do initially -- some steep snow and ice with bits of rock in between.\\u201d\", \"As Steph\'s designated emergency contact, Clemens started to get worried on Sunday night when he hadn\\u2019t heard from her or gotten any messages from the SPOT satellite device Steph was carrying. Still, delays are not uncommon in mountaineering, and at this point his thought was that maybe the climb took longer than expected and they just went back to the hut for another night because it was getting dark. He sent Steph a text message asking her to let him know when they are back and telling her that if he did not hear back he would notify authorities.\", \"The next morning, Clemens still hadn\\u2019t heard back from the climbers. Upon discussing with a mutual friend, Piotr, who was Steph\'s second emergency contact, they agreed that if the climbers were at the hut overnight, it would take them a few hours to get back out. If they still hadn\\u2019t heard from them by afternoon, they\\u2019d call the authorities. It wasn\\u2019t until the media emailed the VOC for comment about an accident involving at that point unnamed climbers that they learned anything had gone wrong.\", \"\\u201cWhen I heard that, I knew she was in that area climbing with friends, and that was when I realized that there might be a bad situation, so I looked up the news report,\\u201d said Clemens. \\u201cI kind of tried to convince myself that the descriptions of the victims wouldn\\u2019t match. So I thought okay maybe they are just there helping out.\\u201d\", \"Elliott, on the other hand, read the story and immediately expected the worst. \\u201cI thought right away that this is them,\\u201d he said. \\u201cJust from the clues, the little hints that the press dropped about the size of the party, the nature of what they were doing, having heard that they were headed in that area.\\u201d\", \"The climbers\\u2019 names couldn\\u2019t be released until their next of kin were notified, but by Monday evening friends learned from the RCMP that the families were in Scotland and Germany, which was enough to confirm the worst.\", \"\\u201cI think it took a couple of days for it to become real. It\\u2019s still making its way slowly,\\u201d said Elliott. \\u201cI mean I guess it\\u2019s been a week now and I was back at work today and able to focus for longer periods of time than I was last week. Life goes on but I guess there\\u2019s still always this funny hope or feeling that we\\u2019ll see him again, or I\\u2019ll walk over to the house and he\\u2019ll be there, or I\\u2019ll get a phone call saying \\u2018hey you wanna go skiing this weekend?\\u2019 It\\u2019ll take a while for that to go away I think.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFrom everything we see, there is nothing that we could take out of it and learn from it, so I didn\\u2019t come up with any conclusions,\\u201d said Jens. \\u201cElena, being a mother of two, she would be very very conservative, even more so than Neil and Steph. And if anything would\\u2019ve been only somewhat sketchy she would\\u2019ve said \\u2018okay stop, we\\u2019re turning around.\\u2019 And so by all of those facts I\\u2019m pretty sure they did everything they could correctly.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe cannot say oh they should have simply done this different or that different. We all wonder. I guess in the most general sense is that it was a risky place to be, but then we all knew them to be conservative in that regard,\\u201d said Clemens. \\u201cRisk is relative. They weren\\u2019t pushing hard at their limits. Was it bad luck or did they make a bad call? We can\\u2019t really tell at this point, and I don\\u2019t know if we ever will. We know they were making good time up the route up until the point when the accident happened. It didn\\u2019t appear to be very difficult for them up \\u2018til then. It\\u2019s something we\\u2019re still puzzling over, in terms of what there is to be learned.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI think when you go to the mountains you know that you can leave your life. It\\u2019s a dangerous place and I guess the more into it you get the bigger the stakes. I think that\\u2019s on the back of everyone\\u2019s mind,\\u201d said Elliott. \\u201cIt never really hits home until you lose someone I guess. You know now we\\u2019re living with the impact of a loss, we\\u2019re seeing people grieving and we\\u2019re seeing the big hole that you leave behind. I think it takes a while to process that. But I think also mountains is where you feel alive, more alive than anywhere else. That\\u2019s certainly how Neil felt. It\\u2019s a place that requires all of your energy and your focus and your attention. I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s really words to describe the rewards. There\\u2019s always this talk of why. I don\\u2019t think that it\\u2019s possible to put words. I think the only explanation is achieved by going out and experiencing and then you just know. The mountains are this beautiful place. Dangerous, for sure, but beautiful.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI think a type of reaction could be to be now more cautious or more scared of the mountains and not want to go there, but I don\\u2019t feel that way at all,\\u201d explained Emily. \\u201cMaybe the cautious part, but he lived his life to the fullest. He was always giving it 100 per cent and doing what he was passionate about, and it makes me want to do what I\\u2019m passionate about. It makes me want to go skiing and try my hardest and do the things that are the most fun and the most full of adventure, and to share that adventure with everybody.\\u201d\", \"Prior to his death, Neil organized a VOC trip for the weekend of January 30 to celebrate Robbie Burns Day, a Scottish holiday. He called it \\u201cBurns and Turns\\u201d -- photos from last year\\u2019s event show him snowboarding in his kilt. For friends who have spent the past couple weeks grieving and putting together a public memorial service, this will be an opportunity to get together and have a good time in Neil, Steph and Elena\'s memory.\", \"\\u201cNeil was like \\u2018there\\u2019s gonna be music, haggis and whisky!\\u2019\\u201d said Emily. \\u201cI think it\\u2019ll be nice to do that in his honour. It\\u2019s sad that he won\\u2019t be there but I think he\\u2019ll be there in spirit. Who knows, to think that far in advance, but it would be nice for it to be a yearly tradition.\\u201d\", \"In terms of what else the VOC does moving forward, Clemens said the club try their best to keep doing what they do while also being mindful to focus less on objectives of climbing and more on enjoying the process. \\u201cWe still want to get people excited about the outdoors. We all have to ask ourselves how much risk are we willing to take for the privilege to experience the outdoors in this way,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I think ultimately it\\u2019s worth spending time in the mountains. [Steph and Neil] wouldn\\u2019t want us to stop enjoying the outdoors.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf anything it just inspires us to keep going out. We\\u2019ll be thinking about them while we\\u2019re out in the mountains, maybe getting a bit closer to them in some ways,\\u201d added Elliott. \\u201cThey were where they liked to be, where they liked to live. I haven\\u2019t seen them but I know there were pictures recovered from Steph\\u2019s camera. And I can guarantee that if you look at those pictures you\\u2019ll see all three of them smiling, living.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe kept going back and forth. It was an interesting conversation to have so close to his actual death because the gist of it was that he would keep on living life to his maximum and he would do everything he does.

Something felt like it was on the line in this game -- more of a Canucks playoff match than a university regular season one. The beer-soaked and record-breaking crowd cheered at every opportunity, giving the T-Birds the energy to rack up a seemingly unsurpassable three goal lead late in the game. But momentum works in an exaggerated way in this league; when a rookie-filled Saskatchewan team notched their first goal of the evening at 8:46 of the third, something clicked. From that point on, the home team could only watch their dominant game unravel.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":\"3,049 was the exact number of people packed into the Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre, and it sounded like it from the moment the puck dropped. The \\u2018Birds took notice, and wasted no time in throwing their weight around, causing a serious headache for the visitors in their own end and in the neutral zone. Within the first minute, Luke Lockhart had hit the crossbar, amping up the crowd even more. UBC net-minder Eric Williams traded long-distance blows with Saskatchewan\\u2019s Ryan Holfeld to keep the game scoreless through 19:59 of the first period.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":\"It was that last second in which Nick Buonassisi blew past the Huskie defender and caught Holfeld moving the wrong way to open the scoring with a buzzer-beater -- exactly what the crowd needed to ramp up the excitement from a deadlocked period.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":\"\\u201cThe other team actually had a wide open net,\\u201d recalled Buonassisi. \\u201cIt was fortunate that he missed it, and I was able to pick up the puck, and I saw their D-man kind of stutter-step and it was kind of an instant play. I saw the goalie go left so I tried to go right, and lucky enough it went in for me.\\u201d\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":\"The Thunderbirds came into the second period confident. They had most of the chances during the first, and were justly rewarded at the tail end. The thousands in the stands were no less energetic. David Robinson felt he needed to establish a tone early on, and gave Holfeld a bit of a snow shower, which drew some Huskies behind the net for a bout of face-washing and headlocks.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":\"\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":\"The second looked better than the first for the \\u2018Birds -- the only time the puck crossed their defensive blueline was when it was iced. Bardaro took the puck right off a defender\\u2019s stick and very nearly put it in from the slot. Fleming caught a rebound from a wraparound attempt and fired it so convincingly that the red light flashed to signal a goal. The man with the best view in the house and the red stripe on his arm, however, disagreed.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":\"Not to be stonewalled for the period, the \\u2018Birds would add another. Jessi Hilton and Luke Lockhart sprung up on a 2-on-1 opportunity and made no mistake with their textbook finish. 2-0 \\u2018Birds. From there, Saskatchewan turned up the heat a little bit, but Williams stood on his head when he needed to.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":\"So it went to what everyone in the stands hoped would be the final frame. At 6:51, Robinson buried a huge rebound top shelf to put the home team up by three, and if you asked the person next to you whether there was any chance of a comeback, you might\\u2019ve gotten a funny look. It just wasn\\u2019t plausible.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":\"But it happened. It started with a bad penalty. Ben Schmidt took a roughing call to put the visitors on the powerplay, they crashed the crease and banged one in over Williams\\u2019 shoulder.

A nail-biting four-on-four overtime period solved nothing, so the game turned to three-on-three for the next five minute, sudden-death period. That\\u2019s when things really opened up. The amount of clear ice was almost comical; every rush was odd-man.
